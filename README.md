# Facebook WinForms App
A Facebook App mockup, created with WinForms as a part of Design Patterns course.

## This project showcases:

* **Usage of OOP and OOD in high level in order to overcome coding dilemmas, encountered through the use of many legacy components in WinForms.**
* **Implementation of a WinForms app from scratch without specific guidelines.**
* **Usage of Facebook APIs in order to create requests to facebook servers and get relevant data to the user.**
* **Implementation of non-facebook features, like auto birthday-comment generator.**
* **Intense and continous work on a relatively large project.**
